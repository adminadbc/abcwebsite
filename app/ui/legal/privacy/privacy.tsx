        <Typography className="font-normal !text-gray-500">
          Advocacy For Better Communities Foundation is committed to
          safeguarding the personal information entrusted to us by our members,
          beneficiaries and stakeholders. We manage your personal information in
          accordance with Alberta’s Personal Information Protection Act and
          other applicable laws. This policy outlines the principles and
          practices we follow in protecting your personal information. This
          policy applies to Advocacy For Better Communities Foundation and to
          any person providing services on our behalf. A copy of this policy is
          provided to anyone on request.

            What is personal information?
          </h3>
          <br />
          We collect only the personal information that we need for the purposes
          of providing support to our clients, including personal information
          needed to:
          <ul className="list-disc mx-5">
            <li>enroll or register them in a program</li>
            <li>send out updates and periodic information</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          We normally collect client personal information directly from our
          clients. We may collect your information from other persons with your
          consent or as authorized by law.
          <br />
          We inform our clients, before or at the time of collecting personal
          information, of the purposes for which we are collecting the
          information. The only time we don’t provide this notification is when
          a client volunteers information for an obvious purpose (for example,
          being sent a newsletter or information about upcoming sessions or
          volunteer calls and such).
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="font-normal !text-gray-500">
          <h3 className="text-lg mt-10 text-abcf text-bold">Consent</h3>
          <br />
          We ask for consent to collect, use or disclose client personal
          information, except in specific circumstances where collection, use or
          disclosure without consent is authorized or required by law. We may
          assume your consent in cases where you volunteer information for an
          obvious purpose.
          <br />
          We assume your consent to continue to use and, where applicable,
          disclose personal information that we have already collected, for the
          purpose for which the information was collected.
          <br />
          We ask for your express consent for some purposes and may not be able
          to provide certain services if you are unwilling to provide consent to
          the collection, use or disclosure of certain personal information.
          Where express consent is needed, we will normally ask clients to
          provide their consent orally (in person, by telephone), or in writing
          (by signing a consent form).
          <br />
          In cases that do not involve sensitive personal information, we may
          rely on “opt-out” consent. For example, we may disclose your contact
          information to other organizations that we believe may be of interest
          to you, unless you request that we do not disclose your information.
          You can do this by checking the appropriate box on our application
          form or by telephoning our local number/toll-free number.
          <br />A client may withdraw consent to the use and disclosure of
          personal information at any time, unless the personal information is
          necessary for us to fulfill our legal obligations. We will respect
          your decision, but we may not be able to provide you with certain
          products and services if we do not have the necessary personal
          information.
          <br />
          We may collect, use or disclose client personal information without
          consent only as authorized by law. For example, we may not request
          consent when the collection, use or disclosure is to determine
          suitability for an honor or award, or in an emergency that threatens
          life, health or safety.

            How do we use and disclose personal information?
          </h3>
          <br />
          We use and disclose client personal information only for the purpose
          for which the information was collected, except as authorized by law.
          For example, we may use client contact information newsletter or
          information about upcoming sessions or volunteer calls and such.
          <br />
          If we wish to use or disclose your personal information for any new
          business purpose, we will ask for your consent. We may not seek
          consent if the law allows this (e.g. the law allows organizations to
          use personal information without consent for the purpose of collecting
          a debt).

          Personal employee information is personal information about an
          employee or volunteer which is collected, used or disclosed solely for
          the purposes of establishing, managing or terminating an employment
          relationship or a volunteer work relationship. Personal employee
          information may, in some circumstances, include a Social Insurance

          <br />
          We can collect, use and disclose your personal employee information
          without your consent only for the purposes of establishing, managing
          or ending the employment or volunteer relationship. We will provide
          current employees and volunteers with prior notice about what
          information we collect, use or disclose and our purpose for doing so.
